# Architecture Decision Record: MockingJ Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
MockingJ needs to parse Swagger/OpenAPI specifications and generate mock HTTP responses that conform to the defined schemas. The system needs to be extensible, maintainable, and provide consistent responses while supporting various data types and response patterns.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a modular architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Core Components

#### FastAPIServer
- Primary application container
- Manages HTTP server lifecycle
- Coordinates between components
- Handles health and meta endpoints
- Provides FastAPI integration
- Responsibilities:
  * Server lifecycle management
  * Route registration
  * Request handling
  * Error management
  * SSL/TLS configuration

#### SwaggerParser
- Parses and validates Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
- Resolves schema references
- Extracts endpoint definitions
- Validates specification correctness
- Responsibilities:
  * File parsing
  * Schema validation
  * Reference resolution
  * Type checking
  * Endpoint mapping

#### MockServer
- Handles mock response generation
- Coordinates between parser and generators
- Manages response creation
- Responsibilities:
  * Request routing
  * Response coordination
  * Error simulation
  * Header management
  * Content type handling

### 2. Data Generation Components

#### MockDataGenerator
- Factory for creating data generators
- Manages generator strategies
- Coordinates data generation
- Responsibilities:
  * Generator selection
  * Data consistency
  * Type mapping
  * Cache coordination
  * Format validation

#### DataGeneratorStrategy (Interface)
- Abstract strategy for data generation
- Implemented by concrete generators
- Defines generation contract
- Concrete Implementations:
  * StringGenerator
  * NumberGenerator
  * ObjectGenerator
  * ArrayGenerator

### 3. Support Components

#### ResponseBuilder
- Constructs response objects
- Handles nested structures
- Validates against schemas
- Responsibilities:
  * Response construction
  * Schema validation
  * Header assembly
  * Content type mapping

#### CacheManager
- Manages response caching
- Ensures consistency
- Handles cache invalidation
- Responsibilities:
  * Cache storage
  * TTL management
  * Cache invalidation
  * Memory management

#### MetricsCollector
- Collects performance metrics
- Tracks system health
- Provides monitoring data
- Responsibilities:
  * Performance tracking
  * Health monitoring
  * Statistics collection
  * Metric aggregation

#### Config
- Manages configuration
- Handles environment variables
- Validates settings
- Responsibilities:
  * Configuration loading
  * Environment handling
  * Validation
  * Default management

### 4. Monitoring Components

#### HealthMonitor
- Tracks system health
- Provides health endpoints
- Monitors dependencies
- Responsibilities:
  * Health checking
  * Dependency monitoring
  * Resource tracking
  * Status reporting

## Design Patterns Used

1. Strategy Pattern
- Used for data generation
- Allows different generation approaches
- Easily extensible for new types

2. Factory Pattern
- Used in MockDataGenerator
- Creates appropriate generators
- Manages generator lifecycle

3. Builder Pattern
- Used in ResponseBuilder
- Constructs complex responses
- Handles nested structures

4. Singleton Pattern
- Used for Config and CacheManager
- Ensures single instance
- Manages shared state

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Highly testable components
3. Easily extensible
4. Type-safe through Python typing
5. Consistent response generation
6. Comprehensive monitoring
7. Efficient caching

### Negative
1. More complex than a monolithic design
2. Requires careful state management
3. Need for comprehensive testing
4. Cache invalidation complexity

## Implementation Notes

1. Type Safety
- Full Python type hints
- Pydantic models for validation
- Runtime type checking

2. Testing
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for flows
- Property-based testing for generators

3. Performance
- Caching for consistent responses
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Resource pooling

4. Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization tracking

## Technical Requirements

1. Python 3.11+
2. FastAPI for HTTP server
3. Pydantic for validation
4. YAML for configuration
5. pytest for testing

This architecture provides a robust foundation for implementing a mock server that can handle complex Swagger specifications while maintaining good software engineering practices and providing comprehensive monitoring and health checking capabilities.
